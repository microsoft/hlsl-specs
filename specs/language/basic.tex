\Ch{Basic Concepts}{Basic}

\begin{note}
  \p HLSL inherits a significant portion of its language semantics from C and C++.
  Some of this is a result of intentional adoption of syntax early in the development
  of the language and some a side-effect of the Clang-based implementation of DXC.

  \p This chapter includes a lot of definitions that are inherited from C and C++.
  Some are identical to C or C++, others are slightly different. HLSL is neither
  a subset nor a superset of C or C++, and cannot be simply described in terms
  of C or C++. This specification includes all necessary definitions for clarity.
\end{note}

\Sec{Preamble}{Basic.preamble}

\p An \textit{entity} is a value, object, function, enumerator, type, class
member, bit-field, template, template specialization, namespace, or pack.

\p A \textit{name} is a use of an \textit{identifier} (\ref{Expr.Primary.ID}),
\textit{operator-function-id} (\ref{Overload.operator}),
\textit{conversion-function-id} (\ref{Classes.Conversions}),
or \textit{template-id} (\ref{Template}) that denotes any entity or
\textit{label} (\ref{Stmt.Label}).

\p Every name that denotes an entity is introduced by a \textit{declaration}.
Every name that denotes a label is introduced by a \textit{labeled statement}
(\ref{Stmt.Label})\footnote{HLSL does not have \texttt{goto}, and labeled
statements are only valid within \texttt{switch} statements.}.

\p A \textit{variable} is introduced by the declaration of a reference other
than a non-static data member of an object. The variable's name denotes the
reference or object.

\p Whenever a name is encountered it is necessary to determine if the name
denotes an entity that is a type or template. The process for determining if a
name refers to a type or template is called \textit{name lookup}.

\p Two names are the same name if:
\begin{itemize}
\item they are identifiers comprised of the same character sequence, or
\item they are operator-function-ids formed with the same operator, or
\item they are conversion-function-ids formed with the same type, or
\item they are template-ids that refer to the same class or function.
\end{itemize}

\p \begin{note}
  This section matches \gls{isoCPP} section \textbf{[basic]} except for the
  exclusion of \texttt{goto} and \textit{literal operators}.
\end{note}

\Sec{Declarations and definitions}{Basic.Decl}

\p A declaration (\ref{Decl}) may introduce one or more names into a translation
unit or redeclare names introduced by previous declarations. If a declaration
introduces names, it specifies the interpretation and attributes of these names.
A declaration may also have effects such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item verifying a static assertion (\ref{Decl}),
\item use of attributes (\ref{Decl}), and
\item controlling template instantiation (\ref{Template.Inst}).
\end{itemize}

\p A declaration is a \textit{definition} unless:
\begin{itemize}
\item it declares a function without specifying the function's body
(\ref{Decl.Function}),
\item it is a parameter declaration in a function declaration that does not
specify the function's body (\ref{Decl.Function}),
\item it is a global or namespace member declaration without the \texttt{static}
specifier\footnote{Global variable declarations are implicitly constant and
external in HLSL.},
\item it declares a static data member in a class definition,
\item it is a class name declaration,
\item it is a template parameter,
\item it is a \texttt{typedef} declaration (\ref{Decl}),
\item it is an \textit{alias-declaration} (\ref{Decl}),
\item it is a \textit{using-declaration} (\ref{Decl}),
\item it is a \textit{static\_assert-declaration} (\ref{Decl}),
\item it is an \textit{empty-declaration} (\ref{Decl}),
\item or a \textit{using-directive} (\ref{Decl}).
\end{itemize}

\p The two examples below are adapted from \gls{isoCPP} \textbf{[basic.def]}. All
but one of the following are definitions:
\begin{HLSL}
int f(int x) { return x+1; } // defines f and x
struct S {int a;int b;};     // defines S, S::a, and S::b
struct X {                   // defines X
  int x;                     // defines non-static member x
  static int y;              // declares static data member y
};
int X::y = 1;                // defines X::y
enum { up, down };           // defines up and down
namespace N {                // defines N
int d;                       // declares N::d
static int i;                // defines N::i
}
\end{HLSL}

\p All of the following are declarations:
\begin{HLSL}
int a;                       // declares a
const int c;                 // declares c
X anX;                       // declares anX
int f(int);                  // declares f
struct S;                    // declares S
typedef int Int;             // declares Int
using N::d;                  // declares d
using Float = float;         // declares Float
cbuffer CB {                 // does not declare CB
  int z;                     // declares z
}
tbuffer TB {                 // does not declare TB
  int w;                     // declares w
}
\end{HLSL}

\Sec{Types}{Basic.types}

\p The \textit{object representation} of an object of type \texttt{T} is the
sequence of \textit{N} bytes taken up by the object of type \texttt{T}, where
\textit{N} equals \texttt{sizeof(T)}\footnote{\texttt{sizeof(T)} returns the
size of the object as-if it's stored in device memory, and determining the size
if it's stored in another memory space is not possible.}. The \textit{object
representation} of an object may be different based on the \textit{memory space}
it is stored in (\ref{Intro.Memory.Spaces}).

\p The \textit{value representation} of an object is the set of bits that hold
the value of type \texttt{T}. Bits in the object representation that are not
part of the value representation are \textit{padding bits}.

\p An \textit{object type} is a type that is not a function type, not a
reference type, and not a void type.

\p A \textit{class type} is a data type declared with either the \texttt{class}
or \texttt{struct} keywords (\ref{Classes}). A class type \texttt{T} may be
declared as incomplete at one point in a translation unit via a \textit{forward
declaration}, and complete later with a full definition. The type \texttt{T} is
the same type throughout the translation unit.

\p There are special implementation-defined types such as \textit{handle types},
which fall into a category of \textit{standard intangible types}. Intangible
types are types that have no defined object representation or value
representation, as such the size is unknown at compile time.
% Note: The above definition is likely incomplete, and it is unclear if minimum
% precision types should be intangible.

\p A class type \texttt{T} is an \textit{intangible class type} if it contains
a base class or members of intangible class type, standard intangible type,
or arrays of such types. Standard intangible types and intangible class types
are collectively called \textit{intangible types}(\ref{Intangible}).

\p An object type is an \textit{incomplete type} if the compiler lacks
sufficient information to determine the size of an object of type \texttt{T},
and it is not an intangible type. It is a \textit{complete type} if the compiler
has sufficient information to determine the size of an object of type
\texttt{T}, or if the type is known to be an intangible type. An object may not
be defined to have an \textit{incomplete} type.

\p Arithmetic types (\ref{Basic.types.arithmetic}), enumeration types, and
\textit{cv-qualified} versions of these types are collectively called
\textit{scalar types}.

\p Vectors of scalar types declared with the built-in \texttt{vector<T,N>}
template are \textit{vector types}. Vector lengths must be between 1 and 4 (i.e.
\( 1 \leq N \leq 4 \) ).

\Sub{Arithmetic Types}{Basic.types.arithmetic}

\p There are three \textit{standard signed integer types}: \texttt{int16\_t},
\texttt{int32\_t}, and \texttt{int64\_t}. Each of the signed integer types is
explicitly named for the size in bits of the type's object representation. There
is also the type alias \texttt{int} which is an alias of \texttt{int32\_t}.
There is one \textit{minimum precision signed integer type}: \texttt{min16int}.
The minimum precision signed integer type is named for the required minimum
value representation size in bits. The object representation of
\texttt{min16int} is \texttt{int}. The standard signed integer types and minimum
precision signed integer type are collectively called \textit{signed integer
types}.

\p There are three \textit{standard unsigned integer types}: \texttt{uint16\_t},
\texttt{uint32\_t}, and \texttt{uint64\_t}. Each of the unsigned integer types
is explicitly named for the size in bits of the type's object representation.
There is also the type alias \texttt{uint} which is an alias of
\texttt{uint32\_t}. There is one \textit{minimum precision unsigned integer
type}: \texttt{min16uint}. The minimum precision unsigned integer type is named
for the required minimum value representation size in bits. The object
representation of \texttt{min16uint} is \texttt{uint}. The standard unsigned
integer types and minimum precision unsigned integer type are collectively
called \textit{unsigned integer types}.

\p The minimum precision signed integer types and minimum precision unsigned
integer types are collectively called \textit{minimum precision integer types}.
The standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types are
collectively called \textit{standard integer types}. The signed integer types
and unsigned integer types are collectively called \textit{integer types}.
Integer types inherit the object representation of integers defined in
\glsdesc{isoC23}\footnote{C23 adopts two's compliment as the object
representation for integer types.}. Integer types shall satisfy the constraints
defined in \glsdesc{isoCPP}, section \textbf{basic.fundamental}.

\p There are three \textit{standard floating point types}: \texttt{half},
\texttt{float}, and \texttt{double}. The \texttt{float} type is a 32-bit
floating point type. The \texttt{double} type is a 64-bit floating point type.
Both the \texttt{float} and \texttt{double} types have object representations as
defined in \gls{IEEE754}. The \texttt{half} type may be either 16-bit or 32-bit
as controlled by implementation defined compiler settings. If \texttt{half} is
32-bit it will have an object representation as defined in \gls{IEEE754},
otherwise it will have an object representation matching the \textbf{binary16}
format defined in \gls{IEEE754}\footnote{IEEE-754 only defines a binary encoding
for 16-bit floating point values, it does not fully specify the behavior of such
types.}. There is one \textit{minimum precision floating point type}:
\texttt{min16float}. The minimum precision floating point type is named for the
required minimum value representation size in bits. The object representation of
\texttt{min16float} is \texttt{float}\footnote{This means when stored to memory
objects of type \texttt{min16float} are stored as \textbf{binary32} as defined
in \gls{IEEE754}.}. The standard floating point types and minimum precision
floating point type are collectively called \textit{floating point types}.

\p Integer and floating point types are collectively called \textit{arithmetic
types}.

\p The \texttt{void} type is inherited from \gls{isoCPP}, which defines it as
having an empty set of values and being an incomplete type that can never be
completed. The \texttt{void} type is used to signify the return type of a
function that returns no value. Any expression can be explicitly converted to
\texttt{void}.

\Sec{Lvalues and rvalues}{Basic.lval}

\p Expressions are classified by the type(s) of values they produce. The valid
types of values produced by expressions are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item An \textit{lvalue} represents a function or object.
  \item An \textit{rvalue} represents a temporary object.
  \item An \textit{xvalue} (expiring value) represents an object near the end
  of its lifetime.
  \item A \textit{cxvalue} (casted expiring value) is an \textit{xvalue}
  which, on expiration, assigns its value to a bound \textit{lvalue}.
  \item A \textit{glvalue} is an \textit{lvalue}, \textit{xvalue}, or
  \textit{cxvalue}.
  \item A \textit{prvalue} is an \textit{rvalue} that is not an \textit{xvalue}.
\end{enumerate}
