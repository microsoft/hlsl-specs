\p The \textit{object representation} of an object of type \texttt{T} is the
sequence of \textit{N} bytes taken up by the object of type \texttt{T}, where
\textit{N} equals \texttt{sizeof(T)}\footnote{\texttt{sizeof(T)} returns the
size of the object as-if it's stored in device memory, and determining the size
if it's stored in another memory space is not possible.}. The \textit{object
representation} of an object may be different based on the \textit{memory space}
it is stored in (\ref{Intro.Memory.Spaces}).

\p The \textit{value representation} of an object is the set of bits that hold
the value of type \texttt{T}. Bits in the object representation that are not
part of the value representation are \textit{padding bits}.

\p An \textit{object type} is a type that is not a function type, not a
reference type, and not a void type.

\p A \textit{class type} is a data type declared with either the \texttt{class}
or \texttt{struct} keywords (\ref{Classes}). A class type \texttt{T} may be
declared as incomplete at one point in a translation unit via a \textit{forward
declaration}, and complete later with a full definition. The type \texttt{T} is
the same type throughout the translation unit.

\p There are special implementation-defined types such as \textit{handle types},
which fall into a category of \textit{standard intangible types}. Intangible
types are types that have no defined object representation or value
representation, as such the size is unknown at compile time.
% Note: The above definition is likely incomplete, and it is unclear if minimum
% precision types should be intangible.

\p A class type \texttt{T} is an \textit{intangible class type} if it contains
an base classes or members of intangible class type, standard intangible type,
or arrays of such types. Standard intangible types and intangible class types
are collectively called \textit{intangible types}(\ref{Intangible}).

\p An object type is an \textit{incomplete type} if the compiler lacks
sufficient information to determine the size of an object of type \texttt{T},
and it is not an intangible type. It is a \textit{complete type} if the compiler
has sufficient information to determine the size of an object of type
\texttt{T}, or if the type is known to be an intangible type. An object may not
be defined to have an \textit{incomplete} type.

\p Arithmetic types (\ref{Basic.types.arithmetic}), enumeration types, and
\textit{cv-qualified} versions of these types are collectively called
\textit{scalar types}.

\p Vectors of scalar types declared with the built-in \texttt{vector<T,N>}
template are \textit{vector types}. Vector lengths must be between 1 and 4 (i.e.
\( 1 \leq N \leq 4 \) ).

\Sub{Arithmetic Types}{Basic.types.arithmetic}

\p There are three \textit{standard signed integer types}: \texttt{int16\_t},
\texttt{int32\_t}, and \texttt{int64\_t}. Each of the signed integer types is
explicitly named for the size in bits of the type's object representation. There
is also the type alias \texttt{int} which is an alias of \texttt{int32\_t}.
There is one \textit{minimum precision signed integer type}: \texttt{min16int}.
The minimum precision signed integer type is named for the required minimum
value representation size in bits. The object representation of
\texttt{min16int} is \texttt{int}. The standard signed integer types and minimum
precision signed integer type are collectively called \textit{signed integer
types}.

\p There are three \textit{standard unsigned integer types}: \texttt{uint16\_t},
\texttt{uint32\_t}, and \texttt{uint64\_t}. Each of the unsigned integer types
is explicitly named for the size in bits of the type's object representation.
There is also the type alias \texttt{uint} which is an alias of
\texttt{uint32\_t}. There is one \textit{minimum precision unsigned integer
type}: \texttt{min16uint}. The minimum precision unsigned integer type is named
for the required minimum value representation size in bits. The object
representation of \texttt{min16uint} is \texttt{uint}. The standard unsigned
integer types and minimum precision unsigned integer type are collectively
called \textit{unsigned integer types}.

\p The minimum precision signed integer types and minimum precision unsigned
integer types are collectively called \textit{minimum precision integer types}.
The standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types are
collectively called \textit{standard integer types}. The signed integer types
and unsigned integer types are collectively called \textit{integer types}.
Integer types inherit the object representation of integers defined in
\glsdesc{isoC23}\footnote{C23 adopts two's compliment as the object
representation for integer types.}. Integer types shall satisfy the constraints
defined in \glsdesc{isoCPP}, section \textbf{basic.fundamental}.

\p There are three \textit{standard floating point types}: \texttt{half},
\texttt{float}, and \texttt{double}. The \texttt{float} type is a 32-bit
floating point type. The \texttt{double} type is a 64-bit floating point type.
Both the \texttt{float} and \texttt{double} types have object representations as
defined in \gls{IEEE754}. The \texttt{half} type may be either 16-bit or 32-bit
as controlled by implementation defined compiler settings. If \texttt{half} is
32-bit it will have an object representation as defined in \gls{IEEE754},
otherwise it will have an object representation matching the \textbf{binary16}
format defined in \gls{IEEE754}\footnote{IEEE-754 only defines a binary encoding
for 16-bit floating point values, it does not fully specify the behavior of such
types.}. There is one \textit{minimum precision floating point type}:
\texttt{min16float}. The minimum precision floating point type is named for the
required minimum value representation size in bits. The object representation of
\texttt{min16float} is \texttt{float}\footnote{This means when stored to memory
objects of type \texttt{min16float} are stored as \textbf{binary32} as defined
in \gls{IEEE754}.}. The standard floating point types and minimum precision
floating point type are collectively called \textit{floating point types}.

\p Integer and floating point types are collectively called \textit{arithmetic
types}.

\p The \texttt{void} type is inherited from \gls{isoCPP}, which defines it as
having an empty set of values and being an incomplete type that can never be
completed. The \texttt{void} type is used to signify the return type of a
function that returns no value. Any expression can be explicitly converted to
\texttt{void}.

\Sec{Lvalues and rvalues}{Basic.lval}

\p Expressions are classified by the type(s) of values they produce. The valid
types of values produced by expressions are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item An \textit{lvalue} represents a function or object.
  \item An \textit{rvalue} represents a temporary object.
  \item An \textit{xvalue} (expiring value) represents an object near the end
  of its lifetime.
  \item A \textit{cxvalue} (casted expiring value) is an \textit{xvalue}
  which, on expiration, assigns its value to a bound \textit{lvalue}.
  \item A \textit{glvalue} is an \textit{lvalue}, \textit{xvalue}, or
  \textit{cxvalue}.
  \item A \textit{prvalue} is an \textit{rvalue} that is not an \textit{xvalue}.
\end{enumerate}
