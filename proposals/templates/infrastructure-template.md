## Introduction

10,000 ft view of the change being proposed. Try to keep to one paragraph and
less than 10 sentences.

## Motivation

Describe the problems users are currently facing that this feature addresses.
Include concrete examples, links to related issues, and any relevant background.

The point of this section is not to convince reviewers that you have a solution,
but rather that a problem needs to be resolved.

## Proposed solution

Describe your solution to the problem. Provide examples and describe how they
work. Show how your solution is better than current workarounds: is it cleaner,
safer, or more efficient?

## Detailed design

_The detailed design is not required until the feature is under review._

This section should grow into a full specification that will provide enough
information for someone who isn't the proposal author to implement the feature.
It should also serve as the basis for documentation for the feature. Each
feature will need different levels of detail here, but some common things to
think through are:

* Is there any potential for changed behavior?
* Will this expose new interfaces that will have support burden?
* How will this proposal be tested?
* Does this require additional hardware/software/human resources?
* What documentation should be updated or authored?

## Alternatives considered (Optional)

If alternative solutions were considered, please provide a brief overview. This
section can also be populated based on conversations that occur during
reviewing.

## Acknowledgments (Optional)

Take a moment to acknowledge the contributions of people other than the author
and sponsor.
