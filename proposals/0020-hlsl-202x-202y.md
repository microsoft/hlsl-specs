## Introduction

This proposal seeks to provide a framework for defining the next two versions of
the HLSL programming language. It seeks to define HLSL 202x as a bridge between
DXC's implementation and Clang's implementation, and HLSL 202y as the next major
feature release.

## Motivation

The HLSL compiler is undergoing a massive transition moving to Clang. Since
the HLSL language is not formally specified and existing implementations
disagree about fundamental behaviors, the new compiler will not be fully
compatible with the previous compilers. This will create three conflicting
implementations.

This poses a challenge for users as they seek to migrate to Clang. Sources used
with DXC may not be compatible with Clang by preventing the ability to switch to
Clang piecemeal or being able to A/B test shaders.

## Version Naming and Management

HLSL versions names match the intended year of completion. Historically we
missed with HLSL 2021 not completing the implementation and deployment in 2023.
Due to schedule uncertainty and a desire to not repeat _that mistake_, future
versions have placeholder names.

The next language version is HLSL 202x. HLSL 202y will release after 202x. As we
near the final release of 202x the release name will change to the target year.
The same will follow for 202y.

The expectation is that HLSL `x` is a placeholder integer value less than `y`.
All features added to HLSL 202x will be implicitly inherited by HLSL 202y.

## Proposed Solution

This proposal adopts the development of two new language versions for HLSL in
parallel. The proposal adopts a narrowly focused HLSL 202x which will be
supported by both DXC and Clang, and a wider focused HLSL 202y feature release
which will only be supported by Clang.

### HLSL 202x

HLSL 202x shall contain features that bridge compatibility between DXC and
Clang. This shall be limited to cases where Clang's implementations do not match
DXC and it is expected to cause potential disruption.

Existing proposals that fall into this category are:
* [Numeric Constants](/proposals/0003-numeric-constants.md)
  * DXC Issue - [[202x] [0003] Numeric Constants](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/issues/7218)
  * Clang Issue - [[202x] [0003] Numeric Constants](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/131808)
* [Conforming Literals](/proposals/0017-conforming-literals.md)
  * Completed in DXC - [[202x] Implementaiton of conforming literals](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/pull/6572)
  * Completed in Clang - [[HLSL] Implement 202x conforming literals](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/91015)
* [Loop Unroll Factor](/proposals/0022-hlsl-loop-unroll-factor.md)
  * DXC Issue - [[202x][0022] Loop Unroll Factor](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/issues/7219)
  * Completed in Clang - [[HLSL] add loop unroll](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/93879)

In addition to the new features, HLSL 202x will remove features that were not
fully supported by DXC. Issues tracking 202x feature deprecations:
* [Effects Syntax](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/issues/380)
* [HLSL Interfaces](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/issues/291)
* [cbuffer variable initializers](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/issues/259)
* [`uniform` keyword](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/issues/135)

HLSL 202x will not include features for all differences between DXC and Clang.
Some of the
[differences](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/HLSL/ExpectedDifferences.html), are
not expected to have meaningful difference to users, or have reasonable source
compatible workarounds. HLSL 202x is specifically for differences that do not
have workarounds and may pose a barrier to adoption.

### HLSL 202y

HLSL 202y is an opportunity to address some frequently requested features that
we can deliver more quickly in Clang than in DXC. Some of the features in HLSL
202y require significant changes to core language behaviors and will likely
cause source compatibility issues.

Two big areas of investment in HLSL 202y are overload resolution and object
initialization. While the two areas are intertwined, we will discuss them mostly
separately.

#### Overload Resolution

In Clang we've adopted overload resolution behavior more similar to C++. This
causes some source incompatibilities as cited in the [clang
docs](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/HLSL/ExpectedDifferences.html). Taking these
behavior changes into HLSL makes HLSL's overload best-match algorithm more
familiar and will produce ambiguous resolution errors instead of potentially
choosing an unexpected overload when ambiguity exists in the source.

Adopting C++ overload best match and set selection rules implements proposal
[0007 `const` non-static member
functions](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/blob/main/proposals/0007-const-instance-methods.md).

Adopting C++ language rules for the contexts in which overload resolution occurs
implements proposal [0008 non-member operator
overloading](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/blob/main/proposals/0008-non-member-operator-overloading.md).

#### Object Initialization

Supporting [C++
constructors](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/issues/303) requires
revisiting HLSL's approach where all objects support aggregate initialization
(braced initializer lists), which makes it connected to proposal [0005 strict
initializer
lists](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/blob/main/proposals/0005-strict-initializer-lists.md).

HLSL 2021 & 202x have special rules for aggregate initializers such that the
source-provided structure of braced initializer lists is ignored and an
element-wise initialization is performed. This conflicts with objects having
constructors, destructors, or user-provided conversion functions. It also
conflicts with [`union`
types](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/blob/main/proposals/0004-unions.md).

HLSL 202y adopts support for constructors and destructors, and C++'s rules for
aggregate initialization.

#### Other Mostly Free Features

Other C++ features have made their way in via Clang's implementation preserving
C++ constructs. A few notable features that we expect to standardize in HLSL
202y are:

* [`constexpr` functions](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/issues/74)
* [`constexpr` variables](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/issues/21)
* [`auto` variable declarations](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/issues/24)
* `static_assert`
* [`bit_cast`](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/issues/318)
* `public`, `private` and `protected` access specifiers.

Additionally, we do have some features that we're experimenting with in Clang
which may or not make the cut for HLSL 202y. Those include:
* [C++ lambdas](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/issues/21)
* [`union` types](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/blob/main/proposals/0004-unions.md)
