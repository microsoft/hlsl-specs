## Introduction

The IsSpecialFloat DXIL Op is used to implement operations, 'isinf', 'isnan', 'isfinite', and 'isnormal'.
Due to a bug (#7496), the IsSpecialFloat DXIL operations were never generated for 16-bit types.

## Motivation

The 'isinf', 'isnan', and 'isfinite' functions (there is no 'isnormal' function), support fp16 but instead of generating a 16 bit
IsSpecialFloat DXIL Op, DXC extends to the 32 bit float op. See (https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/issues/7496).
Some Vendor drivers support the 16 bit IsSpecialFloat op, but some do not. 

## Proposed solution

Beginning with SM 6.9 we would like to have DXC be able to generate this operation, and not extend to 32-bit.
For shader models before 6.9 we want to emulate the functionality using LLVM IR rather than a DXIL op.

We should also update the DXIL validator to disallow the 16 bit DXIL overloads for the 'isinf', 'isnan', 'isfinite',
and 'isnormal' operations for SM 6.8 and below.
