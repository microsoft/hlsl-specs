* Planned Version: SM 6.9

## Introduction

Shader Model 6.9 introduces new features to HLSL which need representations in
DXIL.  This proposal provides an index of the new features:


## Opacity Micromaps

[Proposal 0024] - Opacity Micromaps (OMM)

This adds a new DXIL op, `AllocateRayQuery2` and some new flags.


## Shader Execution Reordering

[Proposal 0027] - Shader Execution Reordering (SER)

This adds a new DXIL type, `%dx.types.HitObject` and 30 new DXIL ops.


## DXIL Vectors

[Proposal 0030] - DXIL Vectors

This enables native vectors, as supported by LLVM 3.7, in DXIL 1.9. A new
`rawBufferVectorLoad` opcode is added that loads an entire vector. Elementwise
intrinsics are extended to accept vector arguments.

The HLSL changes related to this feature can be found in [Proposal 0026] - HLSL
Long Vector Type.

## 16bit IsSpecialFloat

[Proposal 0038] - 16bit IsSpecialFloat

The IsSpecialFloat DXIL Ops are used to implement operations, 'isinf', 'isnan',
'isfinite', and 'isnormal'. Due to a bug (#7496), the IsSpecialFloat DXIL
operations were never generated for 16-bit types.  This bug is fixed for SM 6.9.
