## Introduction

The HLSL compiler includes a post-compile binary analysis tool, the validator.
The validator verifies the validity of the generated program in accordance to
rules defined for each Shader Model, and on successful execution embeds a hash
within the binary. The hash is then used by the runtime to assert that the
binary has not been modified since the validator processed it.

This proposal includes several changes to this flow including changes to how the
validator is packaged. The proposal also includes some proposed changes to the
D3D runtime that change when the validator is run and when the hash is verified.

## Motivation

Validation fulfills a critical role in the HLSL compiler. The HLSL compiler is
able to generate bytecode sequences that are not valid, and we rely on the
validator to catch and surface those errors. This is a foundational design
consideration in DXC. This proposal does not seek to diminish the importance of
validation.

The HLSL team wants developers to run the DXIL validator. The HLSL team believes
that developers want the assurances that the validator provides. However, cases
exist today where developers circumvent the validator because it obstructs their
ability to get things done. Other cases exist where running the validator poses
too great of a performance penalty.

This proposal recognizes the reality that the validator isn't perfect, that
circumventing it is possible (and commonplace), and that we need a different
approach. The goal of this proposal is to provide users with the protections
that validation provides, while also getting the validator out of the way.

The goal of this proposal is to alleviate pain that causes legitimate use cases
to circumvent validation, and allow the validator flow to be smoother for users
that want to run the validator.

### Current State

Today, after the DXIL validator successfully validates a binary it computes a
hash using a modified MD5 hash algorithm, which then gets encoded into the
shader binary. This acts as a weak form of tamper verification allowing the
runtime to check that a shader has not been tampered with after the validator
scanned the binary to ensure it conformed to the target Shader Model's
definition.

The only assurances given to the runtime and driver that a shader's DXIL has
been validated comes from the fact that the hashing algorithm is not published,
so it is assumed that the hash is only computed after validation succeeds. This
assumption is weak and can be proven incorrect since the algorithm has been
published by other entities and is available on GitHub today
[1](#renderdoc-source)[2](#hexops-source).

### Legitimate Reasons Users Circumvent Validation

One of the reasons that developers have circumvented DXIL hashing is to
statically link DXC as a single binary [3](#hexops-devlog). This has benefits
for process launch time which can significantly impact overall compiler
performance.

Another reason users bypass the hashing algorithm is for portability. Users have
wanted to be able to compile shaders for Windows on Linux and macOS for years
[4](#macos-builds). DXC's Linux releases have been troubled and unusable without
modification. DXC still has no official release for macOS, and the investment to
produce one is unlikely to be worthwhile.

Lastly, users circumvent validation in cases where the validator is
prohibitively slow to run. Three examples where this is a motivation for
bypassing validation are:

* Platform mapping layers where other shader bytecodes (i.e. DXBC or SPIR-V) are
  translated to DXIL at runtime.
* Developer tooling scenarios where tools need to rewrite shaders at runtime for
  performance instrumentation.
* Developer tooling scenarios where embedding extra data in the container is
  helpful.

## Proposed solution

The minimum effort initial step is to merge the current implementation of
DXIL.dll into the public DXC source tree. This immediately unblocks users with
portability concerns, and eases our own developer workflows as testing
validation workflows has been restricted due to the current architecture.

As we look to the future we should build the DXIL validator library both as a
dynamic and static library to allow full flexibility. The static library can be
directly linked into dxcompiler.dll and dxv.exe. This will allow simplified
distributions and faster execution of the DXIL validator both for users of DXC
and users of Clang.

We should also evaluate statically linking dxcompiler.dll with dxc.exe. While
this will increase the size of our binary distributions, it may produce a
significant performance increase for users of dxc.exe.

### Reserved Static Hash Values

Due to the nature of the MD5 hash algorithm there are some digest values that
are impossible to compute from message content. We reserve some of these values
to act as known sentinel values for communication with the runtime.

The D3D runtime passes shader hashes to drivers via the device driver interface.
To prevent breaking this use case, the runtime must compute a replacement hash
for the DDI for any shader that contains a sentinel value for its hash.

The table below describes the initial proposed sentinel values:

| Name              | Hash                             |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| BYPASS            | 01010101010101010101010101010101 |
| PREVIEW_BYPASS    | 02020202020202020202020202020202 |

### Hashing for Pre-release Shader Models

When DXC includes the sources for the validator hash, the default compiler flow
should be that all shaders are validated and hashed using what is today the
internal validator.

For pre-release shader models DXC should run the validator, but it should not
apply the hash. Instead it should apply the `PREVIEW_BYPASS` sentinel value 
from the table above. This allows us to differentiate between shaders validated 
by a "final" validator.

### Compatibility

This proposal is fully backwards compatible to older shader models since the
existing runtime hash validation applies except when experimental shader models
are enabled.

When this change is introduced to DXC all shaders compiled by DXC will either
contain a valid hash, contain the `PREVIEW` hash, or fail validation and not
produce an output.

The only exception will be the case where validation is intentionally disabled
(as with the `-Vd`) flag. In that case the hash data in the container will be
zero'd.

### Concerns About Invalid DXIL

As this proposal has been discussed concerns have been raised about allowing
invalid DXIL into the runtime. Due to existing use cases that bypass validation
and the ready availability of the DXIL hash, non-validated DXIL is already going
into the runtime and drivers.

The primary concern expressed from external partners was that driver developers
would needlessly spend time chasing bugs that prove to be caused by invalid
DXIL. The concerned parties agreed that the D3D runtime running DXIL validation
in the debug layer would provide sufficient tooling to mitigate that concern.

A separate concern was raised about the possibility that pre-release shader
model features could infiltrate production shaders. While the changes in this
proposal may seem to make that more likely, this is unlikely to be a significant
concern. Adoption of new shader model features in production software generally
takes years. It is extremely unlikely that a product would use a
multiple-year-old preview compiler for generating final compiled shaders for a
title. The high rate of bugs in preview compilers contributes to making this
even less likely.

## Detailed Design

### D3D Runtime Behavior

Starting with AgilitySDK version 1.615, the runtime adopts new behavior for how 
and when the shader hash is validated, including support for bytecode validation 
in the debug layer.

For shaders with the `PREVIEW_BYPASS` hash, the shader is allowed to execute 
only if developer mode and the experimental feature 
`D3D12ExperimentalShaderModels` is enabled, otherwise the runtime will produce
an error.

For shaders with the `BYPASS` hash, shaders can run without validating the hash 
regardless of whether the machine is in developer mode as long as the shader 
targets a supported non-experimental shader model.

All other values of the hash are assumed to be real hash values.

For shaders that contain a real hash value, the behavior is unchanged. The hash
is verified and the shader executes as it does with existing versions of the 
runtime.

> Note: an important behavior change here is that shaders with zero'd hash data
> will always be treated as invalid by the runtime and rejected.
> 
> We have an exception to allow for legacy zero'd hash shaders. These were built
> using earlier previews and so they're treated as if they had the `PREVIEW_BYPASS` hash set,
> except that the validator will not be invoked on them since this wasn't expected at the time
> they were generated. This exception will be removed once runtimes that support these preview 
> shaders are no longer supported.

#### D3D Debug Layer Validation Control

Apps can configure how the debug layer runtime validates bytecode passed to it. 

The validation is the same code the compiler uses when it endorses bytecode at 
compile time by applying a hash.  A copy of this validation code is in 
the debug layer for it to use.  So it would typically be 
redundant to validate again, but it can be useful to validate shaders that have 
the `BYPASS` or `PREVIEW_BYPASS` hash, or have the option to force validation. 

If the debug layer finds errors when running the bytecode validator it only 
reports validator error strings, but doesn't fail shader creation.  Developers can 
choose to break on `D3D12_MESSAGE_ID_BYTECODE_VALIDATION_ERROR` to catch these specific 
errors while debugging, the via d3dconfig or `ID3D12InfoQueue`.

The validation mode can be configured via `ID3D12DebugDevice1::SetDebugParameter()`:

```C++
typedef enum D3D12_DEBUG_DEVICE_PARAMETER_TYPE
{
    ...
    D3D12_DEBUG_DEVICE_PARAMETER_BYTECODE_VALIDATION_MODE   
} D3D12_DEBUG_DEVICE_PARAMETER_TYPE;

typedef enum D3D12_DEBUG_DEVICE_BYTECODE_VALIDATE_MODE
{
    D3D12_DEBUG_DEVICE_BYTECODE_VALIDATE_DISABLED,
    D3D12_DEBUG_DEVICE_BYTECODE_VALIDATE_WHEN_HASH_BYPASSED,
    D3D12_DEBUG_DEVICE_BYTECODE_VALIDATE_ALL_BYTECODE,
    D3D12_DEBUG_DEVICE_BYTECODE_VALIDATE_MODE_DEFAULT = 
        D3D12_DEBUG_DEVICE_BYTECODE_VALIDATE_WHEN_HASH_BYPASSED
} D3D12_DEBUG_DEVICE_BYTECODE_VALIDATE_MODE;
```

Flag | Definition
---|---
`D3D12_DEBUG_DEVICE_BYTECODE_VALIDATE_DISABLED` | Never invoke bytecode validation.
`D3D12_DEBUG_DEVICE_BYTECODE_VALIDATE_WHEN_HASH_BYPASSED` | Only validate bytecode that has the `BYPASS` or `PREVIEW_BYPASS` hash.  This is the default.
`D3D12_DEBUG_DEVICE_BYTECODE_VALIDATE_ALL_BYTECODE` | Validate all bytecode regardless of hash.  Forcing validation this way could be useful if shaders that might have been hashed manually without the compiler's validator.

Usage example:

```C++
CComPtr<ID3D12DebugDevice1> pDebugDevice;
pDevice->QueryInterface(&pDebugDevice); // available when debug layer enabled
pDebugDevice->SetDebugParameter(D3D12_DEBUG_DEVICE_PARAMETER_BYTECODE_VALIDATION_MODE, D3D12_DEBUG_DEVICE_BYTECODE_VALIDATE_ALL_BYTECODE);

// All subsequent bytecode passed to the debug layer for creating state objects / PSOs etc. 
// will be validated.
```

This control is not thread safe or synchronized with other device methods 
such as creating shaders where the options would apply.  Apps must do their 
own synchronization around changing the validation mode and making calls to any 
other device methods if necessary.

#### Checking for runtime support

If an app uses an AgilitySDK with support for the bypass hash, then
the app can be confident it is supported and so no runtime check is needed.

If the app instead uses the OS D3D12 runtime, and the OS might be older 
than when bypass hash was introduced, support for hash bypass can be 
queried:

```C++
    D3D12_FEATURE_DATA_BYTECODE_BYPASS_HASH_SUPPORTED bypassHashSupport = {};
    if(SUCCEEDED(pDevice->CheckFeatureSupport(
        D3D12_FEATURE_BYTECODE_BYPASS_HASH_SUPPORTED, 
        &bypassHashSupport, 
        sizeof(bypassHashSupport))))
    {
        if(bypassHashSupport.Supported)
        {
            // Bypass hash supported.
        }
    }
    // Note that on an older runtime the CheckFeatureSupport call
    // fail not recognizing the feature at all, implying no support.
```

## Appendix 1: DXIL Hashing Algorithm

The DXIL hashing algorithm is derived from a public domain implementation of
[RFC 1321](#rfc1321). This appendix breaks the code into four separate segments
which provide full implementation of the three related hash algorithms.

### Debug Hash Diff

This is a diff that applies to the original MD5 implementation to produce the
debug hash algorithm. Shaders hashed with the debug hash are only allowed to run
if the debug layer is enabled.

For example, GPU-based validation may patch shader binaries to inject validation
code and then apply the debug hash to make the shader only when the debug layer
is enabled.
