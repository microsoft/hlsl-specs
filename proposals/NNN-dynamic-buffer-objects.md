## Introduction

Dynamic Buffer Objects introduces the ability to create buffer objects directly from GPUVAs. This feature extends the
flexibility of resource binding by allowing buffer objects to be created and managed in HLSL shader code, similar to the
approach used in Shader Model 6.6 for descriptors indexed from descriptor heaps. By enabling dynamic buffer object
creation, this feature provides enhanced flexibility and efficiency in resource management for advanced rendering and
compute workloads.

## Motivation

Currently, applications face significant limitations in resource management due to the complexity and constraints of
root signatures. Root signatures must be carefully designed to accommodate all potential resource binding scenarios,
leading to complex layouts that are difficult to manage and optimize. The existing API restricts the number of available
root view slots, which can be a significant limitation for complex shaders requiring numerous resources. When root view
slots are exhausted, applications must fall back to using root tables, which add additional overhead and complexity that
is unnecessary for many buffer addressing scenarios.

This feature addresses these limitations by reducing dependency on root signatures for buffer object creation, similar
to how descriptor heap indexing (introduced in Shader Model 6.6) reduced the need for complex root signature layouts
when accessing descriptor heaps. By enabling dynamic buffer object creation from GPU virtual addresses, applications can
bypass the root signature bottleneck entirely for many use cases, creating buffer objects on-demand within shaders
without requiring pre-planned root signature slots.

Furthermore, machine learning developers have specifically complained about the lack of ability to access buffers at
arbitrary offsets and cast data to arbitrary structures, capabilities that are readily available in other APIs such as
CUDA. The core limitation is the inability to dynamically create unordered access views for buffers starting at
arbitrary byte offsets with custom element strides, which is a fundamental requirement for many machine learning
algorithms that need to reinterpret buffer data in different layouts. This limitation forces developers to use
workarounds that are less efficient and more complex than necessary, hindering the adoption of DirectX for machine
learning workloads.

## Proposed solution

The proposed solution involves extending the HLSL language to support the creation of new buffer objects directly from
GPUVAs. This is accomplished by loading a `uint64_t` from a buffer and using a new `FromAddress` static function to
create the buffer object in HLSL shader code.

### Example HLSL Compute Shader

Below is an example of an HLSL compute shader that demonstrates the use of Dynamic Buffer Objects:

```cpp
// Define a structured buffer containing GPUVAs
StructuredBuffer<uint64_t> MyAddressBuffer : register(t0);

[numthreads(16, 16, 1)]
void main(uint3 DTid : SV_DispatchThreadID)
{
    // Determine which buffers to dynamically load from
    // ...

    // Load the GPUVAs from a structured buffer (note: different VA's per thread)
    uint64_t startAddress = MyAddressBuffer[NonUniformResourceIndex(resourceIdx)];

    if (startAddress != 0)
    {
        // Increment start address past header
        startAddress += sizeof(MyHeader);

        // Create (pre-thread) raw buffer objects using the calculated GPUVAs
        ByteAddressBuffer MyLocalBuffer = ByteAddressBuffer::FromAddress(startAddress, 4);

        // Load data from the raw buffer objects
        uint2 data = MyLocalBuffer.Load<uint2>(NonUniformResourceIndex(dataIdx));

        // Perform operations with the loaded data
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Detailed design

### HLSL Additions

#### New Static Methods: `FromAddress`

The `FromAddress` static methods allow the creation of buffer objects directly from GPU virtual addresses. These values
are initially generated by using the `ID3D12Resource::GetGPUVirtualAddress` method. These values may be modified by
shader code prior to being used. These methods are used to dynamically create buffer objects within shaders.

**Syntax:**

```cpp
// ByteAddressBuffer creation
ByteAddressBuffer ByteAddressBuffer::FromAddress(uint64_t address, uint32_t alignment);
RWByteAddressBuffer RWByteAddressBuffer::FromAddress(uint64_t address, uint32_t alignment);

// StructuredBuffer creation  
StructuredBuffer<T> StructuredBuffer<T>::FromAddress(uint64_t address, uint32_t alignment);
RWStructuredBuffer<T> RWStructuredBuffer<T>::FromAddress(uint64_t address, uint32_t alignment);

// ConstantBuffer creation
ConstantBuffer<T> ConstantBuffer<T>::FromAddress(uint64_t address); // 256-byte aligned
```

**Description:**

* Inputs:
  * `uint64_t address`: a 64-bit value representing the buffer's starting GPU virtual address.
  * `uint32_t alignment`: the minimum alignment of the buffer's starting GPU virtual address.
* Returns: a buffer object created using the specified address and alignment.

**Programming Rules:**

* `address` must be a _valid_ GPUVA. If an invalid GPUVA is provided, then the behavior is undefined.
* `address` is allowed to be either uniform or non-uniform. No explicit declarations are required.
* For `ByteAddressBuffer` and `StructuredBuffer` types:
  * `alignment` must be a compile-time literal.
  * `alignment` must be a power of 2, and `<= 4096`.
  * For `ByteAddressBuffer`, `alignment` must be `>= 4`.
  * For `StructuredBuffer`, `alignment` must be `>= 1 << min(ffs(stride), 4)`, where `stride` is the byte size of the structure.
  * Invalid alignment values will cause compilation errors.
  * If the actual alignment of `address` does not match the specified `alignment` value, then the behavior is undefined.
* For `ConstantBuffer` types:
  * No `alignment` parameter is required; constant buffers use a fixed 256-byte alignment.
  * The `address` must be 256-byte aligned. If not 256-byte aligned, then the behavior is undefined.

> **Author's note**: The "power of two" requirement comes from the existing DXIL bitfield definition.  The minimum
> alignment of `4` maintains the existing requirements for root view GPUVAs.  The maximum alignment of `4096` seems
> sufficient but can be as high as `32K` if desired.

**Additional Notes:**

* Existing "no bounds checking" rules for root views apply to dynamically created buffer objects.
* Just as "Typed" Buffers cannot be bound as root views, they likewise cannot be created using `FromAddress` methods.
* ConstantBuffer objects created via `FromAddress` follow the same access rules as traditionally bound constant buffers.

### Interchange Format Additions

> **Author's note**: While this proposal is strictly for adding byte address buffer object creation, this feature might
> be extended to other resource objects in the future.  Therefore, the DXIL/SPIR-V details will be defined with this
> extensibility in mind.

#### DXIL Changes

The `FromAddress` static methods require the following DXIL additions:

##### New Opcode Definition

```llvm
; Opcode for FromAddress methods
; Opcode value: 123 (TBD - needs to be assigned from available opcode range)
@dx.op.createHandleFromAddress(i32 123, i64 %address, i32 %alignment, i32 %bufferType)
```

##### Function Declaration

```llvm
; Function Attrs: nounwind
declare %dx.types.Handle @dx.op.createHandleFromAddress(
    i32,                ; opcode (123)
    i64,                ; address (GPUVA)
    i32,                ; alignment
    i32                 ; buffer type (11=ByteAddressBuffer, 12=StructuredBuffer, 2=ConstantBuffer)
)
```

##### Usage Examples

```llvm
; Example of FromAddress usage in DXIL for ByteAddressBuffer
; %address assumed to be defined earlier (e.g., from structured buffer load)
%bufferHandle = call %dx.types.Handle @dx.op.createHandleFromAddress(
    i32 123,           ; opcode
    i64 %address,      ; GPUVA
    i32 32,            ; alignment (compile-time constant)
    i32 11             ; buffer type (ByteAddressBuffer)
)

; Annotate the handle for subsequent operations
%annotatedHandle = call %dx.types.Handle @dx.op.annotateHandle(
    i32 216,           ; opcode for annotateHandle
    %dx.types.Handle %bufferHandle,
    %dx.types.ResourceProperties {
      i32 1035, ; ResourceKind = ByteAddressBuffer(11), BaseAlignLog2 = 5 (alignment = 32)
      i32 0     ; n/a
      }
)

; Use the buffer for raw buffer operations
%data = call i32 @dx.op.rawBufferLoad.i32(
    i32 139,           ; opcode for rawBufferLoad
    %dx.types.Handle %annotatedHandle,
    i32 %offset,       ; byte offset
    i32 undef,         ; element offset (unused)
    i8 7,              ; mask
    i32 4              ; alignment
)
```

```llvm
; Example of FromAddress usage in DXIL for ConstantBuffer
%cbufferHandle = call %dx.types.Handle @dx.op.createHandleFromAddress(
    i32 123,           ; opcode
    i64 %cbAddress,    ; GPUVA (must be 256-byte aligned)
    i32 256,           ; alignment (fixed for ConstantBuffer, could be ignored)
    i32 2              ; buffer type (ConstantBuffer)
)

```

##### Validation Requirements

* The alignment parameter must be a compile-time literal
* For ByteAddressBuffer types, the alignment must be a power of 2, >= 4, and <= 4096
* For StructuredBuffer types, the alignment must be a power of 2, >= 1 << min(ffs(stride), 4), and <= 4096, where stride is the byte size of the structure
* For ConstantBuffer types, the address must be 256-byte aligned (alignment parameter is not used)
* The address parameter must be a 64-bit integer value
* The bufferType parameter must be a valid buffer type identifier (11 for ByteAddressBuffer, 12 for StructuredBuffer,
  2 for ConstantBuffer)

#### Metadata Changes

The `FromAddress` feature requires minimal metadata changes:

##### Shader Flag Addition

A new shader flag bit will be added to indicate Dynamic Buffer Objects usage:

```cpp
// New shader flag for resource object creation from address usage
#define D3D_SHADER_FLAG_USES_RESOURCE_FROM_ADDRESS 0x00080000
```

This flag is set by the compiler when the shader uses the `FromAddress` static methods and can be checked by the runtime
for validation and optimization purposes.

#### SPIRV Support

SPIRV support for `FromAddress` methods requires the following additions:

##### New SPIRV Extension

```spirv
; Extension declaration
OpExtension "SPV_KHR_resource_from_address"
```

##### New SPIRV Capability

```spirv
; Capability declaration
OpCapability ResourceFromAddress
```

##### New SPIRV Instruction

```spirv
; createHandleFromAddress instruction
%result = OpcreateHandleFromAddress %resultType %address %alignment %bufferType
```

##### SPIRV Instruction Definition

* **Opcode**: New opcode for createHandleFromAddress (TBD)
* **Operands**:
  * `%resultType`: The type of the resulting buffer handle
  * `%address`: 64-bit integer containing the GPUVA
  * `%alignment`: 32-bit integer containing the alignment requirement
  * `%bufferType`: 32-bit integer indicating buffer type (11=ByteAddressBuffer, 12=StructuredBuffer, 2=ConstantBuffer)
* **Result**: Buffer handle that can be used with existing SPIRV buffer operations

##### SPIRV Translation from DXIL

```spirv
; Translation of DXIL createHandleFromAddress to SPIRV
; DXIL: %bufferHandle = call %dx.types.Handle @dx.op.createHandleFromAddress(i32 123, i64 %address, i32 %alignment, i32 %bufferType)
; SPIRV equivalent:
%bufferHandle = OpCreateHandleFromAddress %HandleType %address %alignment %bufferType
```

##### SPIRV Validation Rules

* The alignment operand must be a constant instruction
* For ByteAddressBuffer types, the alignment value must be a power of 2, >= 4, and <= 4096
* For StructuredBuffer types, the alignment value must be a power of 2, >= 1 << min(ffs(stride), 4), and <= 4096, where stride is the byte size of the structure
* For ConstantBuffer types, the address must be 256-byte aligned (alignment operand is not used)
* The address operand must be a 64-bit integer type
* The bufferType operand must be a valid buffer type constant
* The result type must be a buffer handle type

##### SPIRV Backend Requirements

* Implement translation from DXIL `@dx.op.createHandleFromAddress` to SPIRV `OpCreateHandleFromAddress`
* Preserve metadata information in SPIRV debug information
* Ensure proper type checking and validation during translation
* Support both uniform and non-uniform address operands

##### SPIRV Runtime Support

* Runtime must support the new SPIRV extension and capability
* Hardware drivers must implement the Resource From Address functionality
* Validation layers must check alignment and GPUVA validity
* Performance optimization for common FromAddress usage patterns

---

### Runtime Additions

#### Runtime Information

The compiler must provide the following information to the runtime for proper `FromAddress` support:

##### Compiler Requirements

* **Resource From Address Usage Flag**: The compiler must set the `D3D_SHADER_FLAG_USES_RESOURCE_FROM_ADDRESS` shader
  flag to indicate that the shader uses the `FromAddress` static methods
  * **Format**: Standard shader flag bit (0x00080000)
  * **Runtime Usage**: Runtime uses this flag to determine if Resource From Address validation and processing is
    required

* **CreateHandleFromAddress Opcode Information**: The compiler must include the CreateHandleFromAddress opcode (123) in
  the shader's opcode list
  * **Format**: Standard DXIL opcode metadata  
  * **Runtime Usage**: Runtime uses this to identify and process CreateHandleFromAddress instructions during shader
    execution

##### Runtime Validation Information

* **Alignment Validation**: Compiler performs compile-time validation of alignment parameters against the fixed
  constraints (power of 2, >= 4 for ByteAddressBuffer, >= 1 << min(ffs(stride), 4) for StructuredBuffer, and <= 4096
  for both; 256-byte alignment for ConstantBuffer)
  * **Runtime Usage**: Runtime can rely on compile-time validation and doesn't need to re-validate alignment constraints

* **Resource Type Compatibility**: Compiler validates that only supported buffer types (ByteAddressBuffer,
  StructuredBuffer, and ConstantBuffer) are created via FromAddress
  * **Runtime Usage**: Runtime can assume all FromAddress calls create valid buffer types

##### SPIRV Translation Information

* **SPIRV Extension Requirements**: Compiler must declare the `SPV_KHR_resource_from_address` extension when translating
  to SPIRV
  * **Format**: `OpExtension "SPV_KHR_resource_from_address"`
  * **Runtime Usage**: SPIRV runtime uses this to enable Resource From Address support

* **SPIRV Capability Declaration**: Compiler must declare the `ResourceFromAddress` capability
  * **Format**: `OpCapability ResourceFromAddress`
  * **Runtime Usage**: SPIRV runtime uses this to verify hardware support

#### Device Capability

##### Shader Model Interaction

* **Shader Model 6.8 Prerequisite**: The bulk of the Dynamic Buffer Objects feature requires Shader Model 6.8 or higher
  * **Rationale**: Dynamic Buffer Objects builds upon existing root view infrastructure introduced in earlier shader
    models
  * **Dependency**: Requires the underlying root view system and GPUVA management capabilities

* **Interaction with Shader Model 6.6**: Dynamic Buffer Objects complements the descriptor heap indexing features
  introduced in Shader Model 6.6
  * **Synergy**: Both features provide dynamic resource access, but Dynamic Buffer Objects operates at a lower level
  * **Coexistence**: Shaders can use both descriptor heap indexing and Dynamic Buffer Objects simultaneously

* **Backward Compatibility**: Dynamic Buffer Objects does not interfere with existing root view functionality in older
  shader models
  * **Isolation**: Traditional root views continue to work as before
  * **No Breaking Changes**: Existing shaders remain unaffected

##### Emulation and Fallback Support

* **No Emulation Below Shader Model X.Y**: Dynamic Buffer Objects cannot be emulated in older shader models
  * **Rationale**: Lacks fundamental infrastructure for dynamic resource binding
  * **Fallback**: Compiler must generate error messages for unsupported shader models
  * **User Guidance**: Developers must target appropriate shader model or use alternative approaches

##### Hardware Capability Requirements

* **Memory Alignment Support**: Hardware must support the specified alignment requirements for buffer objects
  * **Requirement**: Hardware must handle memory access with the requested alignment (power of 2, >= 4 for
    ByteAddressBuffer, >= structure-dependent minimum for StructuredBuffer, and <= 4096 for both)
  * **Validation**: Runtime validates alignment support against hardware capabilities

* **Dynamic Resource Binding**: Hardware must support dynamic creation of resource views
  * **Requirement**: Hardware must be able to create buffer views from GPUVA at runtime
  * **Validation**: Runtime tests dynamic resource binding capabilities during device creation

## Testing

Codegen correctness for both DXIL and SPIRV should be validated through DXC unit-level tests that verify proper
translation of `FromAddress` static methods to the corresponding `createHandleFromAddress` opcodes with correct metadata
generation.

Diagnostic validation should include comprehensive testing of all alignment constraint violations, invalid buffer type
usage, and shader model compatibility checks through automated compiler test suites.

An HLK test should verify that Dynamic Buffer Objects perform memory reads and writes to the correct GPU virtual
addresses across all supported buffer types, alignment values, and uniformity scenarios, ensuring hardware-level
functionality matches the specification requirements for all object creation patterns.
