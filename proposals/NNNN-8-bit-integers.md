* Issues: [HLSL 337](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/issues/337)

## Introduction

This proposal introduces 8-bit integer types to HLSL, to align it more closely 
with C/C++ and other languages, and allow tight interop with the 8-bit types 
used in the Linear Algebra proposal (for example, to serve as the underlying
storage type for `fp8` until that type is added.)

## Motivation

8-bit types are very special in HLSL as they only exist for some arithmetic 
instructions, but aren't generally accessible. For example, cooperative vectors 
allow inputs to be specified as 8-bit quantities, but only by packing them into 
32-bit. This is cumbersome if for example an application needs to modify the 
values before passing in, for example, to add a bias -- the application is now 
forced to unpack the value, modify it, and pack it back in.

## Proposed solution

Introduce two new, native types:

* `uint8_t`: 8-bit unsigned integer
* `int8_t`: 8-bit signed integer

For support and conversion rules, those new types would match the 
[16-bit scalar types](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/wiki/16-Bit-Scalar-Types), that is, new `uint8_t`.

### DXIL changes

[DXIL](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/blob/main/docs/DXIL.rst) 
mentions under [Primitive types](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/blob/main/docs/DXIL.rst#primitive-types) that `i8` is supported only for limited operations. 
With this proposal: `i8` gets supported for computation by shader. For memory 
access, we'd only support loading multiples of 4 `i8`.

DXIL/LLVM IR doesn't discern between `i8` and `u8`, so during lowering, we need 
to restrict/select between the `I` and `U` instructions.

For the elementwise overloads defined in [DXIL vectors](0030-dxil-vectors.md), 
the following subset would be supported:

| Opcode |  Name              | Class              | Note          |
| ------ | --------------     | --------           | ----          |

| 123    | QuadOp             | QuadOp             |               |
| 165    | WaveMatch          | WaveMatch          |               |

TODO: Do we really need `Bfrev`?

### SPIR-V changes

SPIR-V already supports 8-bit integers.
