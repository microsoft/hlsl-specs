  * Ready to merge.
* [Add proposal for scalar layout for constant buffers](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/317)
  * Action Item @llvm-beanz - Move to merge.
* [Rough proposal collecting thoughts on uniformity](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/405)
  * Action Item: @llvm-beanz to update

  * Revisit after namespace fixes in DXC go in.
* [[0023] Adopt C++11 Base](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/blob/main/proposals/0023-cxx11-base.md)

  * Action item: @llvm-beanz to complete design [#526](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/issues/526)

### Current Business

* Needs Review
  * [bitfields spec language](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/743)
    * Action item: @llvm-beanz & @imbelic to review
* Call to accept
  * [C++ Attributes](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/blob/main/proposals/0002-cxx-attributes.md)
    * There was some discussion about the attribute syntax for bindings. In particular the current proposal's text would deprecate applying resource bindings on user-defined types and having the binding apply to the members.
    * Action Item: @llvm-beanz to update proposal to clarify that specific attributes are not final.
    * Accepted by overall consensus.
  * [Restricted Unbounded Arrays](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/blob/main/proposals/0042-restricted-unbounded-arrays.md)
    * Accepted by overall consensus.
  * [`groupshared` arguments](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/blob/main/proposals/0043-groupshared-arguments.md)
    * One point of discussion was around the `[noinline]` attribute.
      * There is a desire that this work in the future.
      * The current implementation in DXC is quite hacky.
      * @llvm-beanz and @tex3d agreed that this is unlikely to be a standardizable feature since it doesn't work across APIs and likely needs changes to DXIL and SPIRV for accurate code generation.
    * Action Item: @spall to update with overloading semantics.
    * Accepted by overall consensus.
