### Current Business
* [Add an initial proposal for HLSL 202x deprecations](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/488)
  * Needs second review

* [Constant Buffer Contexts](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/497)
  * Ready for review
  * Action Item: @hekota, @V-FEXrt
* [Design Considerations Update](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/504)
  * Some concerns were raised about whether or not we should directly refernece The Zen of Python, or if we should instead codify more concrete rules ourselves.
    * Some concerns were raised about the lack of specificity of the Zen of Python.
    * Additional concerns were raised about Python specifically being an interpreted and very different language.
    * Counter points were raised that the intent isn't that these be hard rules, and that nothing about the Zen of Python is specific to scripting languages or dynamic typing.
  * Action Item: @pow2clk plans to review in detail and provide concrete feedback on the PR.
  * Additonal feedback is greatly appreciated.
* [Memory and Execuition Model](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/505)
  * Draft document provides three alternatives on a spectrum from full lockstep to fully indipendent threads.
  * Some discussion about whether or not the code examples are or should be considered valid and it what contexts they might be.
  * We need more extensive review and refinement as well as more fleshing out of the memory model.
  * Action Item: @llvm-beanz to continue iterating on the proposal.
