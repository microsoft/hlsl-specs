### SM 6.9

* [[Shader Execution Reordering] Minor spec inconsistency: HitObject::MakeMiss missing Ray in argument listing](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/512)
* [Proposal for 16 bit IsSpecialFloat dxil op](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/542)
  * These operations were originally added in SM 6.2, however a bug in DXC prevented them from being emitted and tested. We've found IHV drivers in the wild that crash or generate invalid code for these operations so we've decided to retroactively remove them from SM 6.2->6.8 and add them back in 6.9.
  * Action item: @tex3d to review
