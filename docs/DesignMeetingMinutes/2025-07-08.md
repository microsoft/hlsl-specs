### Carried Forward

* [[dxil] Proposal to add new debug printf dxil op](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/324)
  * @pow2clk and @tex3d will review this in more detail.
* [[202x] Propose adding vk::SampledTexture* types](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/343)

* [New Proposal: Draft proposal to modify resource typing in HLSL](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/461)
  * Action Item: @llvm-beanz to work with author
* [Memory and Execuition Model](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/505)
  * Action Item: @llvm-beanz to continue iterating on the proposal.
* [[0001] Consider targeting 202x for hlsl namespace](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/issues/484)
  * Discussion summary between @tex3d, @damyanp & @llvm-beanz:
    * The main concern here is that some code that is valid in DXC today will be invalid in Clang due to howe we're handling namespaces in Clang (which is the behavior we want).
    * DXC has some gnarly and buggy implementation decisions in this area, which may make it difficult to support this.
    * Some of the DXC issues are causing bugs that we need to address for SM 6.9. Those fixes are in-flight.
    * Chris suggests timeboxing an experiment to see how bad it is to support the namespace in DXC.
  * Revisit after namespace fixes in DXC go in.

    * Action item: @llvm-beanz to complete design [#526](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/issues/526)


### SM 6.9

* [Cooperative Vectors Test Plan](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/428)
* [[0029] Minor typos in 0029-cooperative-vector.md](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/503)
* [[0029][0031]In linalg Mul/MulAdd functions, the memory backing the Matrix and Bias buffers must be read-only](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/507)
* [[Shader Execution Reordering] Minor spec inconsistency: HitObject::MakeMiss missing Ray in argument listing](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/512)
* [Proposal for 16 bit IsSpecialFloat dxil op](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/542)
  * These operations were originally added in SM 6.2, however a bug in DXC prevented them from being emitted and tested. We've found IHV drivers in the wild that crash or generate invalid code for these operations so we've decided to retroactively remove them from SM 6.2->6.8 and add them back in 6.9.
  * Action item: @tex3d to review
