## PRs

### Carried Forward
* [[0007] Big update to flesh out const instance methods](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/34)
  * Action Item: @llvm-beanz update based on @tex3d's feedback
  * Action Item: @pow2clk to review the PR and comment
* [[0002] Specify the grammar formulations for attributes](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/65)
  * Action Item: @pow2clk to review.
* [[SM6.8] Add proposal for DXIL 1.8](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/77)
  * This isn't really in a great shape, but it is useful documentation to not lose.
  * Action Item: @llvm-beanz to merge
* [[dxil] Proposal to add new debug printf dxil op](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/324)
  * @pow2clk and @tex3d will review this in more detail.
* [Rework hlsl-vector-type into two specs](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/361)
  * Action Item: @llvm-beanz to review.

### Current Business

* [Add proposal for scalar layout for constant buffers](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/317)
  * Action Item: @llvm-beanz to review updates from AMD
* [[202y] Propose adding C++11-style constructors](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/325)
  * Action Item: @farzonl & @V-FEXrt to review.
* [[202x] Propose adding vk::SampledTexture* types](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/343)
  * Action Item: @llvm-beanz to review.
* [Add resource chapter documenting buffers and bindings](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/344)
  * Action Item: @llvm-beanz to review.
* [Specification language to describe flat conversions and aggregate splats](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/pull/358)
  * The PR needs revision based on feedback, but one outstanding question is
    what do we name the cast?
  * @llvm-beanz: Flat doesn't describe what the conversion does
  * We had a lengthy discussion about @llvm-beanz's dislike of the "flat" term.
  * Alternatives suggested: elementwise conversion, reshape conversion
  * Action Item: @spall to update

## Other Discussion

* Effects Syntax support in HLSL 202x
  * We have an issue to turn effects syntax usage into errors in HLSL 202x - [[202x] Remove HLSL Effects Syntax Support](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/issues/380)
  * This will potentially cause some source breakage for codebases that are shared between DX 10/11 and DX 12.
  * There is at least one known case where DXC assumes valid C++11 syntax is an effects annotation
    ([C++-style initialization of vectors (int2 x{0,1}) does not work, but compiles](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/issues/7111)).
  * Today, DXC ignores the effects annotation, which seems to users to be ignoring a valid intializer.
  * This syntax is C++11 initialization syntax that is not intended to be supported in DXC (which is C++98-based), but will be supported in Clang.
  * Proposed Solution:
    * In DXC: Make all effects syntax parsing errors in HLSL 202x mode.
    * In Clang: Make any effects-like syntax that is valid in modern C++ warn that it is a 202y extension.
