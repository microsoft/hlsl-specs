# HLSL 202x

HLSL 202x is the working name for the language version that will succeed HLSL
2021.

The primary goal of HLSL 202x is to make the language more regular, more
consistent with C++, and to codify language behaviors in a describable and
understandable way for users.

The proposed features for HLSL 202x are a combination of new features for the
language to improve compatibility with C++, and the removal of old features
which caused inconsistency.

As a secondary goal, HLSL 202x strives to make language behaviors more regular
to aid in a long term goal of producing a formal language specification.
